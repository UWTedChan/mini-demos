##### DATA ANALYSIS + WRANGLING #####
# Read books data in

inner_join(bing_sentiments, by = 'word')

# Instead of having each individual word, count the number of positive/negative
# words in each chapter.
jane_austen_sentiment <- jane_austen_sentiment %>%
count(book, chapter, sentiment)
# A chapter's overarching feeling will be calculated by the number of positive
# words minus the number of negative words. Create a new column called
# 'sentiment' with this value.
